# VGG Network Sample

The [VGG network][vgg-paper] is a well-known network with the useful property
of consisting only of convolutional, pooling, ReLU, fully-connected and soft-
max layers[^bias-layer]. This sample code implements the network in pure
SYCL code, for inference only, showing a larger example of using the SYCL-DNN
API. Some rough instructions for how it might be used are provided.

[^bias-layer]: The BiasAdd operation is implemented in this sample directly,
not as part of the convolution operation in the library.

## Obtaining the model weights and classes

There is a preprocessing script that unpacks the weights from the file into
some application-specific data files (the purpose of the sample is to show
SYCL code, not HDF5). The Python helper requires [h5py][hdf5-python] library.

```bash
mkdir data && pushd data
wget --no-verbose https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/keras-applications/vgg16/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
python ${SYCL_DNN}/samples/vgg/h5toBin.py vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
popd
```

## Preparing an image

Similarly, any image can be traced against the weights, but the sample does not
have sophisticated image reading code in it. Instead it expects that the image
will be provided as a normalised 224 x 224 x 3 flattened array, so a Python
script is available to perform this transformation for any image and format
supported by the [PIL][py-img-lib].

```bash
python ${SYCL_DNN}/samples/vgg/img2bin.py my-favourite-pet.jpg
```

## Testing on an image

The SYCL-DNN samples are built in the default CMake configuration. The sample
is built by the target `vgg`. The sample first must be passed the directory
where the binary weights files are stored and the second argument should be
the preprocessed picture that should be classified. The expected output is
of a classification index and a series of times in nanoseconds that corresond
to the total time to run the network on an input, not including data transfer
time.

```bash
${SYCL_DNN_BUILD_DIR}/samples/vgg/vgg data/ my-favourite-pet.jpg.bin
```

## Classifying Images

If you have the tool [`jq`][jq-cite] available, you can obtain better output
from the sample. You will also need the [ImageNet classes][classes].

Something like the following will parse the output from the sample and display
the final classification, obtained from the classes data.

```bash
class_id=`{SYCL_DNN_BUILD_DIR}/samples/vgg/vgg data my-favourite-pet.jpg.bin | \
grep 'classed' | sed -r 's/[^0-9]*([0-9]+).*/\"\1\"/'`
cat imagenet_class_index.json | jq ".$class_id"
```
